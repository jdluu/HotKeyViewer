# Compatibility

## Requirements
*   **Stardew Valley**: Version 1.6 or later.
*   **SMAPI**: Version 4.0 or later.

## Supported Mods
*   **Generic Mod Config Menu**: Fully supported for detailed configuration.
*   **StardewUI**: Built on top of the StardewUI framework (embedded).

## Known Issues
*   **Controller Support**: The overlay currently visualizes keyboard inputs only. Controller button presses may not be reflected accurately on the keyboard layout.
*   **Non-QWERTY Layouts**: The visual layout is fixed to ANSI QWERTY. Pressing "A" on an AZERTY keyboard is physically the same key location, but the on-screen label will functionally reflect the game's binding.

## Reporting Bugs
If you encounter crashes or visual glitches, please report them on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jdluu/HotKeyViewer/issues) page or the Nexus Mods bug tracker.
