# User Guide

## Getting Started

Once you've installed the mod, launch Stardew Valley and load your save file. The HotKey Viewer is active by default but hidden until toggled.

### Toggling the Overlay
Press **F1** on your keyboard to toggle the overlay on and off.
*   You can change this hotkey in the Generic Mod Config Menu settings.

## The Interface

The overlay displays a full standard keyboard layout.
*   **Pressed Keys**: When you press a key, it lights up on the overlay.
*   **Action Labels**: Instead of just showing "E" or "F", the keys show the *action* currently bound to them (e.g., "Menu", "Journal").
    *   *Note: If a key has no action bound, it will show its standard letter.*

## Configuration

You can customize the look and feel of the overlay using **Generic Mod Config Menu**.

1.  Open the GMCM menu (gear icon on title screen or in-game options).
2.  Select **HotKey Viewer**.
3.  **Settings Available**:
    *   **Toggle Key**: Change the key used to show/hide the overlay.
    *   **Current Profile**: Switch between different key label profiles (e.g. "Default", "My Custom Layout").
